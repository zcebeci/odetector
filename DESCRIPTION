Description: An object is called "outlier" if it remarkably deviates from the other objects in a data set. Outlier detection is the process to find outliers by using the methods that are based on distance measures, clustering and spatial methods (Ben-Gal, 2005 <ISBN 0-387-24435-2>). This package introduces a clustering-based outlier detection method. This novel method detects the outliers with three approaches processing typicality degrees that are obtained using the Unsupervised Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm (Wu et al, 2010).
